#Introduction to Python

*Learn Python to make text and 2-D games with a typed programming language!*

##Is this course right for you?

If you are curious about typed programming and have very little to no previous experience, this is a great fit for you. Scratch or other drag-and-drop experience helps, but is not necessary. Typing is required and limited as much as possible - if you are intimidated by typing a few sentences, this course might not be a good fit. Suggested age: 10 to 13.

The only real requirements are curiousity and enthusiasm!

##Description

This course is inspired by the material from the book [Hello World! Computer Programming for Kids and Other Beginners](http://www.amazon.com/Hello-World-Computer-Programming-Beginners/dp/1933988495). The authors of the book will be some of your mentors!

All materials necessary for the course will be provided. If you are interested in more projects after the 6 weeks are over, grab a copy of the book.
